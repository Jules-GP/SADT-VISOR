"""Which file extensions are a volume, a surface, a set of landmarks.

**Shared rather than copied, and that is the exception this package is.**
`CONTRIBUTING.md` says small helpers are copied between tools on purpose --
`iter_scans` and `errors.py` stay duplicated, deliberately. What is shared is
what the same document calls a contract with the outside world, and it names
this table as one: ALI's two engines disagreed about `.stl` before the port,
so the UI accepted files the CLI silently ignored, and the fix was to put the
table in `tools/ALI/common/`. This is that fix, at the width the problem
actually has -- the disagreement was never between ALI's two halves alone.

Measured on 2026-09-24, before this existed: four byte-identical copies of the
scan vocabulary (AMASSS, ASO, Batch_Dental_Seg, AREG), and FIVE different
values for `SURFACE_EXTENSIONS` under one name, from `(".vtk",)` to
`(".vtk", ".vtp", ".stl", ".obj", ".off")`. Nothing in the code said which
difference was a decision and which was an oversight.

**Stdlib only, and no dependency, ever.** This installs into environments whose
pins are deliberately incompatible; anything imported here would have to be
satisfiable by all of them at once. The budget is `os`.

**A tool may read LESS than a format.** The table says what the format IS, not
what a tool handles, and advertising more than you read is the original bug:

    from sadt_naming import SURFACE
    SURFACE_EXTENSIONS = (".vtk",)   # this tool reads only this one

That narrowing is a fact about the tool and belongs beside it. What must not
be written beside it again is the list itself.
