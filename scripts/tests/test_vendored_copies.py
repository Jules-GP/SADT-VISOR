"""The modules every tool carries a copy of must stay byte-identical.

`progress.py` and `scans.py` are vendored into each tool rather than imported
from a shared package, because no package is common to every tool: they are
isolated projects on purpose, and an import between two of them would make one
tool's missing dependency take out the other. CONTRIBUTING.md sets that rule.

But what these two files hold is a FORMAT, not an implementation. `progress.py`
writes the one-JSON-object-per-line stream the SERVER parses, and `scans.py`
names the extensions a caller's data is recognised by. A copy that drifts does
not fail loudly -- it reports progress the server silently ignores, or accepts a
scan its neighbour refuses. Copying is the accepted cost; drifting is not, and
this is what stops it.

When a copy has to change, change every copy.
