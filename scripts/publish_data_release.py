"""Republish every manifest file as ONE data release of this repository.

    python3 scripts/publish_data_release.py --dry-run
    python3 scripts/publish_data_release.py --draft --only TestFile024_ROI.zip
    python3 scripts/publish_data_release.py

Each file is downloaded from the address the manifest lists, ANONYMOUSLY: no
token, no cookie. A file only an authenticated client can read has never been
public, and is refused rather than published. Nothing is ever taken from a
local disk, so nothing that was not already distributed can end up in the
release. The bytes uploaded are the bytes downloaded; their sha256 is computed
on the way.

The release holds each distinct file once, under the `release_name` its
manifest entry gives it -- never derived here, so every name is reviewed in
the manifest before it is published:

  model.<tool>.<name>          a model, under the tool that owns it
  TestFile<NNN>_<suffixes>     a test file, numbered once and for all; the
                               suffixes say what it holds (see the manifest)

The manifest's `name` is unchanged, so every file still lands under DATA/
exactly where it did.

Beside the files the release carries:
  SHA256SUMS   one line per file, `sha256sum -c` format
  SOURCES.md   for each file: its original name and public address, the
               date it was first published there, and the tools that use it

and the run writes `data-manifest.yml` with every republished entry's `url`
pointed at the new release and its `sha256` pinned. Review it, then commit it.

Data releases live beside the tool releases of the same repository, told
apart by their tag: `data-` then the publication date and a counter,
`data-2026.10.09-1`, so several can be cut on one day. A data release is never
marked "Latest": that badge belongs to the tools. Needs the GitHub CLI (`gh`),
logged in with the right to create releases in --repo.
