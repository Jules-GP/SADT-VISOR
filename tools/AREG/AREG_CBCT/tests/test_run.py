"""AREG_CBCT's unit tests: no GPU, no weights, no network.

Split out of the single `tools/AREG/tests/test_run.py` that AREG had before it
became three tools. That file went on importing `sadt_areg`, which no
virtualenv has provided since -- so it could not be collected, and all 84 of
its tests stopped running without anything failing. Found by running each
tool's suite in its own interpreter.

elastix is fast enough on a 48^3 phantom that the registration itself is tested
rather than mocked.

The phantom builders and the fake supervisor live in `conftest.py` now: four
more test modules use them, and the copy here had drifted into carrying a mesh
builder for the intraoral engine this tool no longer has.
