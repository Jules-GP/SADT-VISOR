"""Crop a volume to a Slicer ROI box, and turn a cropped label map into a surface.

Ported from `AutoCrop3D/Crop_Volumes_CLI/`. The geometry is upstream's and is
kept deliberately intact: the ROI's two physical corners are mapped to
continuous indices, truncated to integers, clamped to the volume, and the
volume is sliced between them. Changing that changes every result, so it did
not change.

What did change is everything around it -- how a scan is matched to its ROI,
where the temporary files go, which labels get a colour, and what happens when
one file in a batch is unreadable. Each of those is a defect with a name in

        ROIs:  os.path.basename(file).split('_')[0]

    so `PatientA_01_Scan.nii.gz` keyed as `PatientA_01` while its own
    `PatientA_01_ROI.mrk.json` keyed as `PatientA`. The lookup missed, a bare
    `except` logged and continued, and every cohort whose identifiers contain
    an underscore produced an empty output folder and exit code 0.

    Three further properties, each of which upstream got wrong:

    * the timepoint is KEPT. `_T1` and `_T2` are two scans of one subject and
      each has its own ROI; collapsing them made `P01_T1` and `P01_T2` the same
      key, so the T1 scan was cropped with the T2 box and looked plausible;
    * tokens are dropped whole. `SMITH_ORTHO` survives as `SMITH_ORTHO` --
      upstream's `.split('_OR')[0]` truncated it to `SMITH`;
    * the extension is split off properly, compound extensions included, so
      `Patient.01_Scan.nii.gz` keys as `Patient_01` rather than `Patient`.

    Built on `sadt_areg_common.pairing` for the two things that must not be
    re-derived per tool -- what a compound scan extension is, and how a stem
    breaks into tokens -- but NOT on its `patient_stem`, which drops the

    timepoints and wrong for pairing a scan with its box: `P01_T1` and `P01_T2`

    """Give every cell the colour of the label it was contoured from.

    Upstream set EVERY cell to `LABEL_COLORS[np.max(img_arr)]`, so the per-label
    colouring its own table implies never happened: a five-structure
    segmentation came out uniformly the colour of structure 5.

    `vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes` labels its output with the contour value, and
    `vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter` moves points without changing the cells, so the
    scalars survive the smoothing and say which label each triangle belongs to.
    VTK 9.6 puts them on the CELLS; the point-scalar branch is there because
    older releases put them on the points, and a tool whose colours depend on
    the VTK build is worse than one that checks.
