"""The IOS half of ASO: pair meshes with their landmarks per jaw, register each
jaw onto the reference, write the oriented meshes and transforms.

on tooth centroids) and `ASO_IOS/SEMI_ASO_IOS/SEMI_ASO_IOS.py` (semi-automated,
registering on landmarks). Both drove the same `ICP` class with a different
`option` callable, so they are one function here with that callable as the
difference.

    Everything from the jaw token onwards is normally decoration a previous
    step added (`_Seg`, `_Or`, `_lm`, ...), so the patient is what comes before
    it.

    **The jaw token may also come first**, and that is not a corner case: the
    published IOS reference bundle is `Upper_gold.vtk` / `Lower_gold.vtk`.
    Requiring something before the token rejected the whole bundle with "no mesh
    whose name says which jaw it is" -- verified against
    HUTIN1/ASO v1.0.0 Gold_file.zip. When nothing precedes the token, what
    follows it is the identifier rather than decoration.

    **The identifier ends at the first decoration token**, which is a second jaw
    token or `output_suffix`. Both cases are real and both were broken:

    * a predictor names the jaw again -- ALI and Crown_Seg write
      `<mesh stem>_<Jaw>_<type>_Pred.json`, so the landmark file of
      `Upper_new_9.vtk` is `Upper_new_9_Upper_O_Pred.json`. Without this the
      identifier ran to the end of the name, the pair landed under two
      patients, and Semi-Automated IOS reported "no landmark file for this
      jaw" on the dataset this repository ships;
    * this tool's OWN output keeps the suffix -- `Upper_new_9_Or.vtk` gave
      `new_9_Or`. Feeding a previous run back in, which the caller is
      explicitly allowed to do (see the fallback below), split the same
      patient in two all over again.

    When the jaw token is NOT first, both cases are already covered: everything
    from the jaw token onwards is dropped, decoration included. This branch is
    the one that had no end.

    Upstream paired the first case only because it compared names with `in`,
    which is what made patient `1` match patient `10`; the exact-stem rule that
    replaced it is right, it just has to be given the right stem.

    Raises JawError when no token names a jaw, rather than guessing: the
    original defaulted to Lower, so a maxillary mesh named `patient1.vtk` was
    registered against the mandibular reference and returned as a success.
