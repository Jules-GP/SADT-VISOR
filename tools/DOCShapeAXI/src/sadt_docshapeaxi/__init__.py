    Args:
        surfaces: A `.vtk` surface, or a folder of them (searched recursively).
        model: The checkpoint to use. Its name says which anatomy is being
            graded, on what scale, and with which network -- upstream asked for
            all four separately, so a caller could pair a two-class model with
            a four-class scale and be handed a severity grade the network was
            never trained to produce.
        output_dir: Where the explained surfaces and the report are written.
        explain: Also compute the GradCAM attribution and write it onto each
            surface as a point array. Off, only the predictions are produced,
            which is several times faster.
        output_suffix: Appended to each written surface's stem.
        device: `cuda` or `cpu`. Falls back to `cpu` with a warning when no
            CUDA device is visible.

    Returns:
        `{"outputs": {...}, "predictions": [...], "report": path}` -- the
        `outputs` mapping is what the server turns into the response.
