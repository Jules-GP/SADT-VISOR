"""Classify a 3D shape with shapeaxi, and explain the decision on the surface.

Ported from `DOCShapeAXI_CLI/DOCShapeAXI_CLI.py`. Each surface is rendered from
several viewpoints, a shapeaxi network predicts a class (or a value, for the
regression checkpoint), and captum's LayerGradCam projects the attribution back
onto the mesh as a point array.

The prediction loop is upstream's rather than shapeaxi's own `saxi_predict`,
and deliberately: `saxi_predict` resolves the network with
`getattr(saxi_nets, args.nn)`, while `SaxiMHAFBClassification` and
`SaxiMHAFBRegression` live in `saxi_nets_lightning`. It raises AttributeError
before touching a mesh -- the same defect shapeaxi fixed for `dentalmodelseg`
in 2.0.3 and has not fixed here.
