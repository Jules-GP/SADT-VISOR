"""What each checkpoint is, and everything that follows from it.

Upstream's CLI takes five arguments to say one thing: `data_type`, `task`,
`model`, `nn` and `num_classes`. Only five of their combinations exist, and the
other four values are functions of the checkpoint:

    airways_2_class    binary      2 classes   classification
    airways_4_class    severity    4 classes   classification
    airways_4_regress  regression  1 output    REGRESSION
    condyles_4_class   severity    4 classes   classification
    cleft_4_class      severity    4 classes   classification

Pairing them by hand is how a caller gets a plausible wrong answer: ask for
`airways_2_class` with `num_classes=4` and the run completes, reporting a
severity grade the network never learned. `num_classes` also drives how many
GradCAM maps are produced, so a wrong value silently changes the explanation
too. One argument names the checkpoint; the rest is read from here.

The same reasoning is why Batch_Dental_Seg has one `model` argument rather than
a bundle plus a label table.
