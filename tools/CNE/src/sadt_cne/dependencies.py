"""Importing a third-party package late, and saying so when it is not there.

Every heavy or optional import in this tool goes through `require`. Two reasons,
both of them defects upstream had:

* **the schema must cost nothing.** CI imports this package on every pull
  request to publish the schema, and the server regenerates it at startup with
  the tool's own interpreter. Neither may pay for loading an inference engine.
* **a missing reader must cost the notes that need it, not the run.** Upstream
  called `sys.exit(1)` when `pymupdf` OR `python-docx` was absent
  (`CNE_CLI.py:105-115`), so a folder of forty `.txt` notes could not be
  extracted because a PDF reader nobody was going to use was missing.

It also holds `preload_cuda_runtime`, which is the same idea one layer down: a
shared library the wheel links but does not ship, opened before the thing that
needs it, and never fatal when this deployment does not need it at all.

    The CUDA build of `llama-cpp-python` LINKS `libcudart.so.12` and

    from a wheel by policy, the way it excludes the driver. On a workstation
    with a CUDA toolkit installed the dynamic loader finds them anyway, which is
    exactly why this is easy to miss: the deployment image is `python:3.13-slim`
    and has no CUDA at all, and there `import llama_cpp` dies on

        OSError: libcudart.so.12: cannot open shared object file

    before a single line of this tool runs. Measured, in that image, with the
    card attached.

    So they are pinned in `pyproject.toml` as `nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12` and
    `nvidia-cublas-cu12` -- the same wheels at the same versions every torch
    tool in the image already carries, so the image hardlinks them instead of
    keeping a second copy -- and opened here with `RTLD_GLOBAL`, so that the
    `dlopen` llama.cpp does moments later resolves against them. It is what
    `import torch` does, for the same reason.

    packages nor any need of them, and must not fail here; nor must a
    workstation whose loader would have found the system copy regardless.
