"""How a client lays the panel out. Presentation only.

Nothing here can change what `run()` accepts: `describe.py` refuses a layout
naming an argument the signature does not publish, which is what keeps this from
drifting the way the old hand-written argument tables did.

Two boxes. The first is what a clinician fills in; the second is the generation
settings, which have working defaults and exist so a run can be reproduced and
audited rather than so anyone has to choose them.
