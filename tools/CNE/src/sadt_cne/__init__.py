    """Extract structured findings from free-text clinical notes with a local LLM.

    Args:
        notes: One clinical note (.txt, .pdf or .docx), or a folder of them for
            a cohort. Folders are searched recursively and the extension is
            matched case-insensitively, so notes filed per patient and a
            `NOTE.PDF` off a Windows share are both found.
        notes_type: Which fine-tune is being run, "TMJ" or "Ortho". It selects
            the system prompt and the context window together, and it must match
            the model picked below -- they are two different models.
        model: The quantised GGUF model, named from what this server hosts. A
            hosted bundle folder holding exactly one .gguf resolves to it; one
            holding several is refused rather than resolved by sort order.
        output_dir: Where the extractions are written. Nothing is written
            outside it, and it may not be the notes folder itself.
        max_tokens: The longest answer the model may give per note. An answer
            cut off at this limit is reported as a failure and never written:
            truncated JSON parses as nothing, and upstream wrote the fragment as
            if it were the extraction.
        temperature: Sampling temperature. 0 makes the same note extract to the
            same answer twice, which is what lets a result be checked.
        context_tokens: The context window, in tokens. 0 means the note type's
            own default (TMJ 6144, Ortho 2048).
        seed: The sampler's seed, so a run above temperature 0 is still
            reproducible.
        device: "cpu" or "cuda". This tool pins the CPU build of llama.cpp, so
            "cuda" only offloads where a CUDA build has been installed in its
            place; it is otherwise a no-op.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding per note an `Extraction_<note>.json` and
        an `Extraction_<note>.txt`, plus `CNE_report.json`.
