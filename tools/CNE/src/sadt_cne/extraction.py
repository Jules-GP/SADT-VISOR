"""The model: finding it, loading it, asking it, and reading its answer.

Ported from `CNE_CLI/CNE_CLI.py`'s inference block (`:141-251`). What differs:

* **the note type is a fixed choice, so its two readings cannot disagree.**
  Upstream compared `notesType == "TMJ"` when picking the context length
  (`:150`) and `notesType.upper() == "TMJ"` when picking the system prompt
  (`:193`). `"tmj"` therefore got the TMJ instruction with the Ortho context of
  2048 tokens -- a long note silently truncated, from a spelling difference.
  Here the value is a `Literal["TMJ", "Ortho"]`, validated by the server before
  `run` is entered, and both readings come from the same table.
* **a truncated answer is a failure, not a result.** Upstream capped generation
  at 500 tokens and, when the JSON that ran off the end failed to parse, wrote
  the truncated blob as if it were the extraction. `finish_reason` says exactly
  when that happened, and it is treated as the failure it is.
* **temperature defaults to 0.** Upstream used 0.1, so the same note extracted
  twice gave two different answers. A clinical extraction that cannot be
  reproduced cannot be checked.
* **stderr is not surgically redirected.** Upstream dup2'd the process's stderr
  onto /dev/null around the model load with no `try/finally`
  (`CNE/CNE.py:155-169`): a load that raised left the whole process writing its
  traceback into the void, permanently. `quiet_stderr` is a context manager, so
  the restore happens on every path including the raising one.
