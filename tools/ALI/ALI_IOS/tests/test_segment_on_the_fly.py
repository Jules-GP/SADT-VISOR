"""A mixed batch: the meshes that already work first, the rest segmented.

A clinician sends a folder of intraoral scans. Some have been through
`Crown_Seg` and carry a tooth-label array; some have not. The landmark networks
are pointed at teeth, so the raw ones are nothing they can be asked about --
and until now that refused the WHOLE batch with a message naming a tool the
person sending the request has no reason to have heard of.

What is pinned here is the ORDER and what survives a failure, not the
inference: the labelled meshes are processed first, so their landmarks are on
disk before a second of segmentation is spent, and every way the segmentation
can fail costs the meshes it was asked about and nothing else.

The engine and the supervisor are both stubbed. Nothing here needs a GPU,
pytorch3d or a model bundle; what it needs is vtk, to write meshes that really
do and really do not carry a label array -- that being the actual question the
run branches on.
