"""Everything ALI_IOS does around inference: discovery, the landmark selection
and the run report. `engine.py` only has to know how to place landmarks.

ALI used to be one tool choosing an engine from the data. Splitting it in two
moved that question out of the run and into the request: this tool is the
intraoral engine, and an input holding CBCT volumes is refused by name rather
than half-processed.

No DICOM here, unlike ALI_CBCT: a DICOM series is a volume by definition, so
detecting one is that tool's business. It also needs itk, which this
environment does not carry.

**A mesh with no tooth labels is segmented mid-run rather than refusing the
batch.** The landmark networks are pointed at teeth, so a mesh that carries no
label array is nothing they can be asked about -- and a clinician sending a
folder of intraoral scans has no reason to know that `Crown_Seg` exists, let
alone which half of their cohort has already been through it. So the meshes
that already work are processed FIRST and their landmarks are on disk before a
second of segmentation is spent; the rest go through `Crown_Seg` and follow.
That ordering is the whole design: a run cancelled, timed out or killed half
way still leaves the cheap results behind.

It is the exception CONTRIBUTING.md allows, for the reason it allows it: the
server cannot chain the two beforehand without segmenting the meshes that did
not need it and without losing that ordering. With NO supervisor -- a direct
call, a checkout, an older server -- nothing changes: the batch is refused
exactly as it was, by the check that names the tool to run.
