"""ALI_IOS -- Automatic Landmark Identification on intraoral surface scans.

Per tooth, the mesh is rendered from a dozen viewpoints and a 2D UNet predicts
masks that are projected back onto the surface. Writes one Slicer markups file
per scan.

Split out of the former single `ALI` tool. The reason is concrete: this engine
needs pytorch3d, which ships as a wheel built against one exact torch version
(`+pt2110cu128`), so it is pinned to torch 2.11. The CBCT engine has no reason
to move, and while the two shared a virtualenv, neither could be pinned without
the other. They share their output format and their input vocabulary, both in
`sadt_ali_common`, and nothing else.

# the marker a property of the REQUEST rather than of the tool, so nothing
# downstream could know it: pairing a scan with its landmarks, and working out
# which results belong to one patient, both have to strip a marker they can
# predict. A caller wanting to label a run labels the output FOLDER, which
# costs nobody a guess.

# Published through `OUTPUT_SUFFIXES` below, which is how the server learns it

    """Place anatomical landmarks on an intraoral surface scan.

    Args:
        input: One intraoral surface (.vtk/.stl), or a folder of them for a
            batch. Folders are searched recursively. An input holding CBCT
            volumes is refused by name rather than half processed -- run
            ALI_CBCT on those.
        model: The model bundle, holding flat checkpoints named with an 'O' or
            'C' token and an 'Upper' or 'Lower' one, e.g. `Upper_O_model.pth`.
        output_dir: Where results are written -- one `<scan>_lm_<ID>.mrk.json`
            per scan, mirroring the input's own folder tree, plus
            `run_report.json`. Nothing is written outside it.
        networks: Occlusal predicts the occlusal point and the mesio- and
            disto-buccal cusps; Cervical predicts the cervical lingual and
            buccal points; Mucogingival predicts one point per lower tooth on
            the gingival margin rather than on the crown, and runs on the
            mandible only. A point it had to place from a fit of the arch,
            rather than from the render, carries a caveat in its own
            `description` field and in `landmarks_degraded` in the report.
        landmarks: Predict exactly these landmarks -- naming any of them
            REPLACES the family selection rather than narrowing it, which is
            what lets a caller ask for the points it needs instead of taking a
            whole family to use three of them. Left empty, `networks` decides,
            which is what a client showing no family control relies on.
        device: "cuda" or "cpu". CUDA falls back to CPU when no card is
            visible, with a warning.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding the markups files and the run report.

    The landmark networks are pointed at teeth, so a mesh has to carry a
    per-point tooth-label array. One that does not is sent to `Crown_Seg`
    through the supervisor and processed after the meshes that already had
    theirs -- the ready ones first, so their landmarks are on disk before a
    second of segmentation is spent, and `segmented_on_the_fly` in the run
    report says which meshes needed it. A mesh `Crown_Seg` cannot label is
    reported as that one mesh failing, never as the batch failing.

    With no supervisor -- a direct call, or a server too old to inject one --
    an unlabelled mesh refuses the batch as it always did, naming `Crown_Seg`:
    run it over the meshes yourself and pass its output here.
