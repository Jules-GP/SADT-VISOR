    """Label every tooth of an intraoral scan with its dental number.

    Args:
        meshes: One intraoral surface (.vtk/.stl), or a folder of them for a
            batch. Folders are searched recursively and the output mirrors the
            input tree, so two patients whose meshes share a file name stay
            apart.
        model: The crown-segmentation checkpoint (a .pth file), or a folder
            holding it -- the published one is named for the training run that
            produced it, `<date>_val-loss<number>.pth`, and is found inside a
            folder however deeply it is filed. That is what lets a caller hand
            over a whole models directory without knowing where the file sits;
            a folder holding two of them is refused, naming both. Left empty,
            this tool uses the checkpoint installed for it.
        output_dir: Where the labelled meshes are written, plus
            `run_report.json`. Nothing is written outside it.
        array_name: Name of the point-data array the labels are written to.
            Left empty it follows `numbering` -- `Universal_ID` or `FDI_ID` --
            so the name can never disagree with the integers underneath it.
            Every tool that reads these meshes looks for the Universal spelling,
            which is what makes an FDI mesh refused downstream rather than read
            as a different set of teeth.
        suffix: Added to each output name, e.g. `arch_Seg.vtk`.
        numbering: Universal or FDI tooth numbering. This changes the integers
            written into the array, not the mesh, and whatever consumes the
            result has to agree -- the report records which was used.
        skip_segmented: Pass a mesh that already carries labels through
            unchanged instead of spending minutes re-predicting it. That is
            what makes a mixed batch of raw and pre-segmented meshes one call.
        device: "cuda" or "cpu". CUDA falls back to CPU when no card is
            visible, with a warning.
        num_workers: DataLoader workers shapeaxi uses to load meshes. Forced to
            at least 1: shapeaxi builds its loader with persistent_workers=True,
            which PyTorch rejects at 0.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding the labelled meshes and the run report.
        The report lists every mesh that now carries labels under
        `segmented_meshes` -- that is what a caller sequencing this before ALI
        reads.
