"""`model` as a DIRECTORY: finding the crown checkpoint inside one.

`model` used to be a single `.pth` and nothing else. It still is when a caller
passes one -- the first test here is that promise -- but the server hands a
hosted-model argument the whole of `DATA/<tool>/models/` when nobody named a
bundle, and ALI_IOS passes on the directory IT was handed when it asks this
tool to label a mesh mid-run. Neither knows where the file sits inside.

The folder those two hand over is shared: `DATA/ALI/models/` holds 243 ALI
checkpoints beside the one crown checkpoint. So the discovery has to RECOGNISE
a crown checkpoint rather than take any `.pth`, and the fixture below is the
real bundle's file names, not invented ones.
