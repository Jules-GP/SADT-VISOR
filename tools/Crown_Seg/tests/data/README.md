# Test data

Nothing is committed here. The CI suite builds its own three-triangle meshes
with VTK and stubs `_run_shapeaxi`, so input discovery, the already-segmented
bypass, the output tree and the run report are all exercised without a
checkpoint, a GPU, or the `segmentation` extra.

## Staging the checkpoint and a mesh

Both are small and public, and the server's `scripts/data-manifest.yml` holds
the URLs and sizes:

| File | Size | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `07-21-22_val-loss0.169.pth` | 6.6 MB | Fly-by-CNN release 3.0 |
| `T1_01_U_segmented.vtk` | 15.9 MB | ALIDDM release v1.0.4 |

```bash
scripts/setup-models.sh --tool CrownSeg      # from a VISOR-serve checkout
```

Note that the published test mesh is **already segmented** -- it carries a
`Universal_ID` array. It exercises the passthrough branch as it is; pass
`skip_segmented=False` to force the network to run on it anyway, which is what
the real-model test does.

## Running the real-data tests

`tests/test_real_data.py` holds four of them. All are marked `models`, two also
`gpu`, and both markers are **deselected by default** -- `-o addopts=` is what
turns the default selection off so `-m models` can select them:

```bash
uv sync --extra segmentation     # a prebuilt pytorch3d wheel, see README.md
SADT_CROWNSEG_MODEL=/path/to/DATA/CrownSeg/models/07-21-22_val-loss0.169.pth \
SADT_CROWNSEG_MESH=/path/to/DATA/CrownSeg/testfiles/T1_01_U_segmented.vtk \
uv run pytest -m models -o addopts=
```

Two of the four need no card: they pin the published mesh's 294 260 points and
run the already-segmented bypass on it. The other two run the network.

Write manual runs into the repository's gitignored `output/` directory, never
next to the inputs.
