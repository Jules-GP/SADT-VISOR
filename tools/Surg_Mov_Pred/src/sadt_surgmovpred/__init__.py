"""SurgMovPred -- predicted surgical movements from pre-operative cephalometrics.

One stacking regressor per predicted measurement, each shipped with the scaler
it was trained against. A run loads every model found under `model`, resolves
each model's expected features against the input table's columns, and skips any
model whose features the table does not carry -- so an input with fewer
measurements yields fewer predicted targets rather than an error.

The pipeline is in pipeline.py. Only `run` is public.
