"""nnUNet v2 inference for BatchDentalSeg, isolated from the pipeline.

The upstream widget drove nnUNet through `SlicerNNUNetLib.Parameter` and a
`QProcess`, which is why most of that file is process management: killing a
crashed inference tree, reclaiming stray workers, a RAM watchdog. None of it
applies here -- the Python API returns when it is done, and the server bounds
concurrency.

The resampling runs on the GPU too (see `_enable_gpu_resampling`), which is
where the run time actually goes -- the network is a fraction of it. AMASSS
measured that first; the four bundles here were measured separately, because
their models are not AMASSS's and a numerical cost measured on one network says
nothing about another. See README.md, "GPU resampling".

AMASSS carries a near-identical module and they stay separate copies. In the
server that was because `registry.py` imported every tool at startup, so one
tool's missing dependency would take both out of the registry; here it is
because the two packages share no environment at all and may pin different
nnUNet versions. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

torch and nnunetv2 are imported lazily even though the lockfile guarantees
them: `scripts/describe.py` imports this package on every CI run to publish the
schema, and that must not pay for a CUDA stack.
