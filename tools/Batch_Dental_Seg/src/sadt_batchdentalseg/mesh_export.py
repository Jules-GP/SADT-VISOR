"""Surface exports for a segmentation: STL, OBJ, VTK, and one merged VTK.

**Why this exists here and not in the client.** The local module did its mesh
exports inside Slicer, through `slicer.modules.segmentations` and a scene node
per label. None of that exists on a server, which is why the exports were the
one part of BatchDentalSeg deliberately left unported. Doing them here instead
means every consumer gets them -- a Slicer panel, a `curl`, another tool
through the supervisor -- rather than only the callers that happen to be
running inside Slicer.

**The geometry.** SimpleITK mask -> `vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes` -> clean ->
windowed-sinc smoothing -> decimation, which is the shape AMASSS's
`vtk_export` already uses on the same kind of data. Marching cubes runs on the
ORIGINAL scan grid, so a CBCT at 0.33 mm yields a triangle per voxel face:
detail no mask actually carries, a mask being accurate to about half a voxel
to begin with, and enough of it to make a cohort's worth of meshes unusable
both to ship and to open. `surface_decimation` is what bounds that, and it is
an argument rather than a constant because it is lossy.

**One file per label, except the merged VTK.** A tooth is a separate object to
anyone who opens these, and STL and OBJ cannot carry a label array to separate
them again afterwards. The merged VTK is the exception: it is one file holding
every surface with a `Label` cell array, which is what the local module wrote
and what downstream tooling reads.
