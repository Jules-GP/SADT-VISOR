"""Mask R-CNN over a CBCT, one axial slice at a time.

Ported from `CLIC/runner/clic_runner.py`. The network is torchvision's
`maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn` with its two heads resized to the checkpoint's class
count, applied to each slice of the volume as a 3-channel image; the detections
that clear a score threshold are painted into a label volume that keeps the
input's affine and header, so the two open aligned in a viewer.

Four things differ from upstream, each because a server runs this rather than a
laptop with someone watching:

* **the checkpoint is named, not guessed.** Upstream took
  `sorted(model_dir.glob("*.pth"))[0]` -- the alphabetically first file in the
  folder, with no check that it was the only one and an IndexError when the
  folder was empty. Which model vintage ran must never be a surprise.
* **the class count is read from the checkpoint**, not hardcoded to 4. The
  head's shape is in the state dict; a checkpoint trained on a different number
  of classes fails on `load_state_dict` with a shape mismatch nobody can read,
  where here it simply works.
* **a folder is walked recursively, and files are what is returned.** Upstream's
  collector returned SUBDIRECTORIES whenever any of them held a scan, and the
  runner then called `nib.load` on a directory. It also advertised `.nrrd`,
  `.mha` and `.mhd`, none of which nibabel reads -- accepted and then ignored,
  the trap `.stl` fell into in ALI.
* **one scan failing costs one scan.** Upstream ran one process per scan from
  the Slicer module, so a crash ended that scan; here the loop is inside, and
  it has to be told to keep going.
