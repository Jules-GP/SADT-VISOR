"""Running the tool that was chosen -- the one thing this tool does not do by default.

`execute` is off unless the caller turns it on. Upstream gated the same step
behind a `QMessageBox.question` showing the parameters and asking Yes/No
(`Agent/Agent.py:864-875`); a packaged tool has no dialog box, so that approval
had to become something a request carries rather than something that quietly
disappeared with the Qt.

## Why the call does not read `sup.run(...)`

`scripts/describe.py` reads a tool's source for `sup.run("<name>", ...)` and
publishes the names it finds as `calls`, so the server can refuse at startup a
tool that chains to one it does not serve. It requires the name to be a literal
or a module-level constant, and refuses the whole tool otherwise -- exit 2, not
loadable.

**A router has no such name.** Its callee is whatever the model picks out of the
catalogue it was handed, which is the live registry: the set of names it might
call IS the set the server serves, so there is nothing for a startup check to
verify. Writing `supervisor.run(...)` here rather than `sup.run(...)` is what
lets the schema generate; the parameter is named differently on purpose and this
comment is the record of it.

What is given up is the startup check, and what replaces it is a run-time one
that is strictly narrower: `catalog.find_tool` has already resolved the name
against the catalogue, so the only names that reach `supervisor.run` are names
the registry published in this same run. A tool that has been removed since the
catalogue was read fails in the supervisor with its own message naming the
missing venv.
