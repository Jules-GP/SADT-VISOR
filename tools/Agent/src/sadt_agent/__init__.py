"""Agent -- route a free-text request to one of this server's tools.

Not an imaging tool. A local language model reads what a clinician typed, picks
one tool out of the server's own catalogue, and extracts that tool's parameters
from the same text. It **proposes**; it runs the chosen tool only when the
caller asks it to, with `execute`.

The catalogue is an input, and its default source is the live registry. See
`catalog.py` for why that replaced the hand-written manifest upstream carried.

    """Route a free-text request to one of this server's tools.

    Args:
        prompt: What the user wants, in their own words. The whole routing
            decision is made from this and the folders below.
        output_dir: Where the decision is written -- `routing.json`, the run
            report, and in Ask mode `advice.md`. With `execute`, the chosen
            tool's own outputs land in `run/` inside it. Nothing is written
            outside it.
        catalog_file: A JSON file holding what the server's `GET /tools`
            returns: every tool, its arguments, their types, whether they are
            required, and their choices. Leave it empty and the live registry is
            read instead, from `SADT_API` -- which is the point of the whole
            design: the catalogue is generated from each tool's own signature by
            that tool's own interpreter, so it cannot drift from what the tools
            actually take.
        mode: "Agent (Automated)" picks a tool and fills its parameters.
            "Ask (Interactive)" answers with methodology advice and never
            proposes a run, whatever `execute` says.
        folders: The folders holding the data this request is about. They are
            the only paths the model is shown, and it is told to use them
            verbatim. Sent as a list, so a folder whose name contains a comma
            stays one folder.
        history: Earlier turns of this conversation, as a JSON array of
            `{"role": "user"|"assistant"|"system", "content": "..."}`, so a
            follow-up that only supplies a missing parameter still makes sense.
            Empty means a fresh conversation; anything that is not that shape is
            an error rather than a silently forgotten conversation.
        candidates: How many tools the model is shown, best first. 0 means all
            of them. The ranker only narrows when it has signal: a request that
            matches nothing gets the whole catalogue rather than an arbitrary
            slice of it.
        execute: Run the chosen tool, through the supervisor, once the proposal
            is complete. Off by default and deliberately so -- a model choosing
            what to run on patient data unattended is a decision a person should
            make. It is refused anyway when no tool was chosen, when a required
            argument is missing, or when the router's own confidence is below
            0.5.
        endpoint: The Ollama server to talk to, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.
            Empty means `OLLAMA_HOST`, then loopback. The endpoint is an
            operational prerequisite: this tool does not install Ollama, does
            not start it, and does not pull models.
        model_tag: The Ollama model to route with, e.g. `qwen3:8b`. It must
            already be pulled on that server. Called a tag rather than a model
            because it is neither a file nor a bundle this server hosts: an
            argument named `model` is published as a name picked from
            `DATA/<tool>/models/`, and this is a string an Ollama server
            resolves.
        temperature: Sampling temperature. 0 makes the same request route to the
            same tool twice, which is what lets a decision be checked.
        seed: The sampler's seed, so a run above temperature 0 is reproducible.
        timeout_seconds: How long to wait for one model call, and for reading
            the live registry.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding `routing.json` -- the decision, as
        `{tool, arguments, confidence, reasoning, alternatives}` -- the run
        report, and whatever `execute` produced.
