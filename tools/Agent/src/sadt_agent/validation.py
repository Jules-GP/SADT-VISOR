"""Check what the model extracted against what the tool actually declares.

The catalogue is generated from each tool's own `run()` signature, so unlike
upstream's hand-written manifest these checks are against the real thing: a
`choices` list here is a `Literal[...]` in the callee's signature, and a value
outside it is a 422 the caller would have received anyway. That is the whole
argument for taking the catalogue from the registry.

Three checks upstream had are deliberately NOT here:

- **The folder-extension check.** `parameter_validator.py:191` rejected any
  argument whose NAME contained "folder" or "dir" if its value ended in one of
  seven extensions -- a list missing `.nrrd`, `.mha`, `.gipl`, `.dcm`, `.vtp`,
  `.obj` and `.off`, every one of which the tools accept. So it was a guess
  about the argument's meaning, checked against an incomplete guess about the
  file's. The schema says `path` and does not distinguish a file from a
  directory; nothing here pretends otherwise, and the tool itself gives the
  precise error if the path is the wrong kind.
- **`min` / `max`.** `parameter_validator.py:233,242` read fields no manifest
  entry ever set, and `scripts/describe.py` cannot emit them: a numeric bound is
  not part of the published vocabulary. Checking a field that never exists is
  not a check.
- **Filling in defaults.** `utils.complete_with_defaults` copied every optional
  parameter's manifest default into the proposal, keyed by `p.get("name", "")`
  -- so every parameter that happened to lack a name collapsed into a single
  `""` key and was injected as a phantom argument no tool declares. The
  defaults are in the callee's own signature; restating them in the proposal
  adds a second copy that can only drift, and makes it impossible to see which
  values the *user* actually asked for. What is proposed here is what was
  extracted, and nothing else.
