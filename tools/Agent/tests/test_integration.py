"""The tool as the SERVER runs it: another interpreter, a subprocess, JSON in.

`sadt_testkit.run_tool` is the same contract `server/execution/runner.py`
implements -- same coercion by annotation, same result file, same
error-class-name convention -- so these check the things an in-process test
cannot: that `folders` survives as `list[Path]`, that `catalog_file` arrives as
a `Path`, and that a failure reaches the caller under the exception name the
server maps to a status code.

They need no Ollama. Every one of them fails on purpose, before or at the model
call, which is what makes them runnable anywhere. The successful round trip is
in `test_live.py`, marked `models`.
